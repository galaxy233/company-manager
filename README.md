# CompanyManager

A simple one-page application to manage companies and contacts. Built with Angular 2.

## Development

This repository contains two services: the dev server provided by angular-cli, and a proxy server to handle requests to the API.

Run `npm install` to install required dependencies.

Run `node server.js` to start the proxy server.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
